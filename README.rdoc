== Rotten Tomatoes Twilio App

Native smartphone applications sometimes can take way too long to load and use. This app was created out of a need to receive RT scores for movies quickly and efficiently. 

I love movies and frequently rent DVDs from RedBox.  Rather than hold up the line or quickly settle on a movie I'm not so sure about I can now use this app to quickly retrieve RT score's for different movie titles. Simply send a text to your Twilio number with the movie title and receive a text with the RT score within seconds.
